This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to handling null values within arrays.  The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from PHP's loose typing; a simple `foreach` loop might not explicitly handle `null` values, leading to unexpected errors or incorrect results. The solution emphasizes explicit null checks within the loop to ensure robust handling of various input scenarios.
